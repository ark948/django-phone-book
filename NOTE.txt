> adding pagination
> add pagination configs to rest_framework config var in settings.py
> test, works fine. commit


> adding filtering
> add filter config var to rest_framework config var in settings.py
> pip install django-filter
> add the following to contact list view:
    filter_backends = [filters.SearchFilter]
    search_fields = ['title']
> this topic can be further discussed, but for now this suffices.
> test it


> adding hyperlinks
> users need to view the detail of their contacts in their contacts list
> a new field must be added to contact serializer named details
> do not forget to add it to included fields as well (still in contact serializer)
> test it in contacts list, works fine

> other features that could be added, api throttling, caching, csv export and import, contacts' date localization
> more tests
> improved authentication and authorization system
> frontend
> encryption
> extra comment field on contact model
> selectable tables and batch delete (maybe on frontend)

> i think i'm going to fix the authentication system and move on to deployment


> But brefore that, let's just give throttling a try...
> throttling is similar to permissions. it determines if a request should be authorized. it is used to control the rate of requests that client
> ... client can make to api
> like permissions, multiple thottles can be used
> e.g. one restrictive throttle for unauthorized requests, and one less restrictive one for authenticated requests
> as with permissions and authentication, throttles are also defined as classes
> before running the main body of a view, each throttle in the list is checked, if any of these checks fails...
> ... an exceptions.Throttled will be raised. and the main body will not run
> setting the throttling policy:
> the default policy could be set globally, using the 'DEFAULT_THROTTLE_CLASSES' and 'DEFAULT_THROTTLE_RATES' in settngs.py>rest_framework
> they can also be set in view
> the throttle classes used by DRF, use django's cache backend. so it should also be configured


> deploying (cancelled, going to add a web front and fix the authentication process)
> first, let's check if all authentication and authorization routes are ok.
> login (ok)
> logout (ok)
> signup (ok)
> verification (error)
> password reset (error)
> for that i'm going to install postman and try it out.
> i did installed it. and it's harder than i thought. i watch a tutorial later.

> ok, there are two login routes,
> api-auth/login/ -> for browsable api
> dj-rest-auth/login/ -> just api (i'll use this one)
> i will use httpie
> cmd: http http://127.0.0.1:8000/dj-rest-auth/login/
> this will just get the page
> http POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/dj-rest-auth/login/ (on purpose, will give error)
> http --json POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/dj-rest-auth/login/ username="testuser" password="hello123*"
> only this worked


> Moving all api routes to localhost//api/
> OK
> trying to add a pages app that will host the front page

    path("accounts/", include("accounts.urls")),
    path("accounts/", include("django.contrib.auth.urls")),
> since we already had an accounts app, we need to update its urls.py
> add a signup view to accoutrs/urls.py
